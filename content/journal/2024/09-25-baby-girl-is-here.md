I've been meaning to write but somehow don't seem to have enough time or energy. A lot has happened since last entry.<!--more--> Let's see what I still recall.

Around 9th Sept or so, Maiko's phone, which we'd bought last year around this time, stopped taking charge. We tried different cables, adapters, restarts, and stuff, but it wouldn't budge. At last, I tried an old new cable, and it started charging and didn't lose it after a couple of seconds (like it was doing before). I, very carefully, placed it on the table—thinking that if I'm not careful, it might lose charge again. Well, it charged all the way up to 100%. Later, we found that the existing cable had very minute cut marks—most probably cut by Tachan. But the phone didn't take charge with the other cables we tried and still occasionally shows some issues—so there seems to be some issue with the phone as well.

I've been wanting to purchase a new phone for myself; my iPhone is around seven years old at this point. And been inclined to go the Android route (Google Pixel) this time and thought it would be a good time, as both the iPhone (being about 7 years old at this time) or Maiko's phone could give out at any time. Well, long story short—I've bought a Pixel 8a in white (porcelain?) color and have been tinkering with it since then.


On the 14th, we went to Lake Ashi in Hakone. It was a beautiful place. Maiko's company friends also joined, and Maiko was the organizer. I think we were around 35 people in total, including kids. Maiko organized the whole thing—salute to her. Maiko was looking after everyone, and I was looking after Tachan, so we didn't get any time to admire the view or even visit the lake on the 14th. Barbecue, drinks, and late-night chats with friends were good, though.

Tachan had his first-year vaccine the week before. Though he had recovered from the vaccine fever on Monday, he seemed to have developed some stomach bug and had thrown up in the morning in the car and then threw up in the middle of the night and cried a lot. Worried, we headed back home early in the morning. Well, Lake Ashi—we did come to see you but couldn't :gomenne: We headed home, and the rest of the crew decided to go fishing. Ah well, Tachan and his stomach bug :sweat-smile:

We had a nice ride home. Tachan tried vomiting a couple of times but didn't actually. He cried a bit but for the most part enjoyed and laughed on the way home. After returning the car, we went to the hospital in Musashi-Kosugi. The doctor told us that it's some stomach issue but is getting better. Relieved, we came home.

While heading home, I received a great news. My younger brother and sister-in-law had become parents to their first daughter. The whole family has been giving suggestions for names since then, but nothing is decided as of now. The baby was born through a c-section. Most of the ladies (Tachan as well) in the house were sick at the time. My `badi Mm-ma` had an operation for kidney stones just a few days before, Mm-ma had a fever, `badi bhabi` is also seeing the doctor about her `rasodies`, and well, the new mother as well. Bloody coincidence.

The baby was kept in NICU for a couple of days (this I got to know about a week later) but has been discharged and certified fit :smile: now. Both the mother and baby are at home, and most of the other ladies in the house have recovered as well. Bloody coincidence.
