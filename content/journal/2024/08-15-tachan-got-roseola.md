So the earthquake wasn't that severe, but there definitely was one around 1945 JST, and we experienced something of about magnitude 2-3.<!--more--> I was on the second floor, working out and talking to my mom on the phone, and rushed down as it came. Maiko came with Tachan in her lap (it's our protocol to gather by the main door in the event of a quake). She then gathered all our emergency supplies by the door.

We had a little pool party at home on Sunday. The water was cold, and the weather was extremely hot - so it was fun. Tachan enjoyed it a lot, but he keeps to himself and doesn't play with anyone else during these times (maybe all the toys and the colorful air-pumped pool are too stimulating for him).

Tachan showed elevated body temperature on Monday, but we didn't give it much thought. On Tuesday, Maiko had work, so I took child care leave. By Tuesday afternoon, his temperature was very noticeable and making him a bit uncomfortable, but he was still giggly and playing. By the night, he had a fever of about `38.3C` and was often crying. He didn't want to take any solids and didn't show much appreciation for the milk but drank it anyway (that's a relief).

Maiko took him to the hospital on Wednesday. The doctor mentioned it was something with his stomach, which makes Maiko think that it was because of the food I give him whenever I'm eating. But my theory is that it was the cold water during the pool party. I didn't tell Maiko—she organized the pool party. The temperature reached about `39.1` by the night, making everyone very uncomfortable. But Tachan was still giggling and playing at times. By this morning, the fever had gone down. But there are rashes all over his body, and they have increased a bit since morning. So, it seems it was neither the food nor the pool party but the `Roseola` fever all along. The doctor mentioned that it's normal after the fever and that they should subside by tomorrow.

(edit: 2023-08-16) - Rashes made him very uncomfortable in the night. He woke up multiple times and cried a lot, making Maiko and I very nervous. She made calls to some of the hospitals; they asked not to come in as an emergency case and rather visit a clinic in the morning if the condition got more severe. Fortunately, by 8 o'clock in the morning, the rashes were gone, and he is sleeping like a baby (it's 11 o'clock now).

Well, my 2024 H1 performance review came in today. I had a score of `3` and `4`, out of `5`, for impact and competency, respectively. Manager says I need to pick up some flagship project and advertise my work more to gain those juicy impact points. Off to 2024 H2 :rocket:
