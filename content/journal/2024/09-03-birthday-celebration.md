It's been many days since the last post, so for this one, I forced myself to write, hopefully to get myself back in the flow.<!--more--> This weekend, 31st August, we held the birthday party for Tachan. We invited our friends and Maiko's brothers. Maiko's brothers got some work and couldn't make it. Four of my Indian friends, along with their wives and girlfriends, showed up.

It's interesting that so much has changed in just a couple of years. It feels like just yesterday we were out of college and single. And now, most of us are married, and some have kids or are thinking about having them. Things are moving so fast. If you blink longer than usual, you might end up missing a major life event. Tachan himself is growing too fast. I guess all kids his age grow too fast. It feels like just yesterday, he couldn't even sit by himself, and now he is running across the whole house, climbing up the stairs. It makes me both happy and sad. Sometimes I wish that time would stop and we'd stay like this forever, laughing and giggling and running around all day long and then falling asleep in my arms.

The party was a blast. It was good to see everyone in person after a couple of months. There was some exciting news (someone is soon going to be a parent) and lots of discussions about investing/betting in crypto.
