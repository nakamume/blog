Maiko has gone for the evening for her friend's retirement party. Though because of some strange events of fate, everyone except the one being retired is going to join<!--more-->

It turned out that the retiree had got COVID and got to know about it this morning. They messaged Maiko and told her that they are not going to make it to the party. Reservations were already made, Maiko called the restaurant and they told her that late cancellations would cost 3K per person. Now the remaining six people, including Maiko, didn't want to waste 3K/each, so they decided to go and enjoy themselves.

Winter is finally here. It's been raining for the last two days and temperatures are under 20. The AC has been running on warm mode since yesterday night. A huge pile of laundry is being dried inside the second-floor room with the help of a fan. They are getting dried but have also gotten that weird smell that comes from wet clothes. It seems the sun will be out tomorrow and we and our laundry will be able to enjoy the outside.
