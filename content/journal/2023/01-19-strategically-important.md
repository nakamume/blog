This entry I've copied from my Notion. That's the reason it belongs to 2023, even though I started this blog in August 2024. This is around the time when my then company decided to fire 40% of the workforce.<!--more--> What follows next is the exact (with grammar and syntax fixed) entry from Notion.

On January 13, 2023, SmartNews fired ~40% of staff in the USA and China. Around a 40% reduction is expected to happen in Japan as well. Though they are asking for voluntary resignations (VRs), if the 40% quota isn't reached with the VRs, people might be fired as deemed fit by the management. There was a 4-hour meeting with the SmartNews management. The CEO says he takes full responsibility for the layoffs—and by that he means to get SmartNews back on track and ensure that SmartNews achieves its mission of delivering quality information. 🤷 Isn't that his job?

I talked with my manager today. He says **my position** is strategically important for the company's future, and they don't plan to lay me off. Well, that's some relief. If I apply for voluntary resignation, my application would be denied.

## Thoughts
- Roles/positions/departments are more important and are of strategic importance than the individuals. In hindsight, though, the individual might have been important; that's why they were in that position/role.
- Companies/organizations serve their shareholders/stakeholders and are only loyal to the revenue and profits. They won't think twice before firing you to save some costs.
