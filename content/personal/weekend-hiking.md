Last weekend I finally got out on the trails after weeks of planning. There's something about being surrounded by nature that resets the mind.

## The Trail

The path wound through dense forest before opening up to stunning valley views. About 3 hours of steady climbing rewarded with a panoramic vista.

## Lessons Learned

- Always pack more water than you think you need
- Starting early beats the crowds and the heat
- The journey matters as much as the destination

Looking forward to the next adventure.
