## Start with Assumptions

Most bugs come from incorrect assumptions. Before diving into code, list what you think is true and verify each one.

## Reproduce First

If you can't reproduce it, you can't fix it. Spend time creating a reliable reproduction before anything else.

Whether it's git bisect or commenting out code, narrowing down the problem space is the fastest path to the answer.

## The Meta-Lesson

The best debuggers I know are endlessly curious. They want to understand why, not just fix the symptom.
