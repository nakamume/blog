## EXPERIENCE
<hr />

### Senior Software Engineer - Platform | SmartNews Tokyo (July 2022 - Present)
- Led the upgrade of **30+ EKS clusters** (**3K+ nodes**) across three Kubernetes versions by implementing an automated EC2 AMI pipeline with **Packer** and **CircleCI**, coordinated API-deprecation migrations with teams, created rollback strategies; resulted in reduced upgrade time by **60%**.
- Scaled the observability platform to handle **40B+ daily events** by designing a **Kafka**-based buffering system with **OpenTelemetry Collector** and **Refinery**; implemented adaptive autoscaling using historical load patterns and queue metrics, cutting compute costs by **50%** and eliminating processing failures during peak load.
- Drove cross-team initiatives that trimmed cloud-infrastructure spend by **$1M/year** through systematic identification and cleanup of unused resources and underutlized, improving **Karpenter** consolidation; developed automated policies for EBS snapshot lifecycles, load-balancer pruning, and container-image retention across **300+ projects**.
- Strengthened compliance with **ITGC/ISMS** by enforcing strict production/non-production separation; migrated **300+ projects** from static credentials to **OIDC** tokens in **CircleCI**, introduced **IAM** role boundaries, and leveraged **VPC flow logs** to detect cross-environment access.
- Modernized infrastructure management by introducing **Crossplane**-based provisioning for **100+ systems**; improving developer experience by enabling self-service provisioning, RBAC-aware access, and continuous reconciliation.
- Designed and led a **dual-stack networking** migration, adding IPv6 support across VPCs with zero downtime; updated AWS load-balancer and DNS controllers for **IPv6/AAAA** records, created migration playbooks, and delegated tasks—lowering IPv4 costs and mitigating address exhaustion.
- Improved incident response by establishing structured protocols for critical production issues; resolved IPv6 routing failures in Ads systems, CI/CD pipeline outages, cross-cluster DNS conflicts, and container registry throttling, provided runbooks, and implemented SLO-based alerting.

### Software Engineer - Platform | SmartNews Tokyo (Dec 2021 - June 2022)
- Enhanced infrastructure security by replacing a legacy **bastion** host that used shared SSH keys with a pool of ephemeral tunnel instances; built a CLI tool that leverages **AWS EC2 Connect**, **IAM**-based authentication, and **SSH ProxyCommand**, reducing security risks and seamlessly integrating with existing SSH workflows for **200+ developers**.
- Developed a standardized **E2E** testing framework for Kubernetes controllers; created reusable components for infrastructure tests (pod creation, DNS resolution, load-balancer provisioning) and integrated automated metrics collection and alerting, reducing **MTTD** and **MTTR** through SLO-based error detection.

### Software Engineer - DevOps Lead | Telus International (Nov 2019 - Nov 2021)
- Led a **17-person** distributed team through the separation of shared infrastructure; designed and executed a zero-downtime migration strategy for **10+ services**, maintaining 99.9% availability and continuous developer workflows.
- Improved CI/CD reliability by implementing Jenkins **pipelines-as-code** using the **Jenkins DSL** plugin, replacing manual pipeline management in the Jenkins UI; migrated **50+ pipelines**, added **Git**-based version control with PR reviews, and enabled automated rollbacks.

### Software Engineer - SRE | Works Applications Tokyo (Oct 2017 - Oct 2019)
- Designed and built an environment-scheduler system that used usage analytics and custom policies to shut down idle staging and development environments; adopted across **10+ environments** and saved **$36K/year** in compute costs.
- Developed a ChatOps automation platform for **100+ internal users**, integrating with ticketing and HR tools to streamline operations workflows and reduce manual toil.
