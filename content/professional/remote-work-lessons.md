## The Good

- Deep work is easier without office interruptions
- Flexible hours mean working when you're most productive
- No commute gives back hours each week

## The Challenges

- Communication requires more intentionality
- It's easy to overwork when home is the office
- Building relationships takes extra effort

## My Approach

I keep strict boundaries—work stays in the office room, and I "commute" with a morning walk.
