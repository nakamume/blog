Code reviews are one of the most valuable practices in software development. Here's what I've learned over the years.

## As a Reviewer

Good code reviews focus on:

- **Logic and correctness** - Does the code do what it's supposed to?
- **Readability** - Will someone else understand this in 6 months?
- **Edge cases** - What happens when things go wrong?

## As an Author

Receiving feedback well is a skill:

- Assume good intent
- Ask clarifying questions
- Learn from patterns in feedback

## The Human Element

Remember there's a person on the other end. Be kind, be specific, and celebrate good work when you see it.
