According to Kotaro, he has never been fed. Ever. Despite evidence to the contrary.

## The Schedule

- 6:00 AM - Breakfast (announced at 5:30 AM)
- 12:00 PM - Lunch (optional dramatic performance if delayed)
- 6:00 PM - Dinner (the main event)

## The Rules

1. Wet food must be room temperature
2. The bowl must be full enough that he can't see the bottom
3. Someone must be present while he eats
4. Treats are a right, not a privilege

## The Reality

He eats the same food every day and acts like each meal is a surprise gift.
