Kotaro has very specific requirements for his 16 hours of daily sleep. Here are his top-rated locations.

<!--more-->

## The Sunny Window

Rating: 5/5 stars. Only available during certain hours, which makes it premium real estate.

## The Cardboard Box

Rating: 5/5 stars. It doesn't matter what size—if it's a box, it's a bed.

## My Keyboard

Rating: 4/5 stars. Warm, gets attention, but sometimes results in being moved.

## The Laundry Basket

Rating: 5/5 stars. Fresh from the dryer is best, but even cold laundry will do.
